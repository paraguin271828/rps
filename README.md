# Rock Paper Scissors

## A small and very bare bones (in regards to the desing part) Rock/Paper/Scissors game written in Javascript.

The Player can enter his/her name, give the AI oponent an alias and choose how many rounds should be played.

The AI chooses random moves out of the available three,
while the player can set his/her own for each round via radio buttons
which describe the moves with the help of emojis.

The winner is determined by most wins from all of the rounds played. Draws are of course taken into consideration.
